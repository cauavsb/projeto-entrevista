            <h1>INTERVIEW WITH LUIS EDUARDO</h1>
            <p>Hello and welcome, everyone. Today, we have the privilege of engaging in a conversation with Luis Eduardo, an expert in programming with a specific focus on <strong>web development</strong>. We will explore the intricacies of web programming, discuss the latest trends, and gain valuable insights from Luis Eduardo's extensive knowledge in this field. Without further ado, let's dive into this enlightening discussion about the fascinating world of <strong>web development</strong>...</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Before we start, could you give us a brief introduction, including who you are and what you do for a living?</h3>
            <p>I am Luís Eduardo. Today, I am professor at IFPE. I have already worked as software engineer (some of them as Fullstack developer or cloud engineer) in some companies as Motorola, UFCG, Compass, Ericsson and Itau.</p>

            <h3>How did you get interested in this area?</h3>
            <p>I've always been interested in technology in general, but I think that when I started learning how to develop software (at that time, using C language) and use technology to solve problems.</p>

            <h3>What web development technologies do you think are essential for a developer today?</h3>
            <p>New technologies always emerge, but having a strong tech base must be the first priority to understand the tech world. Web developers must have a strong base (HTML, CSS and Javascript). After that, developers should know a web framework such as React or Angular.</p>            

            <h3>What are the main challenges you see students facing when learning web programming and how do you help them overcome them?</h3>
            <p>The main challenge is to teach students to have critical and logical thinking. One way to help them is to teach them how to reduce a physical problem to a few logical premises and use a programming language (and its syntax) to implement an acceptable solution.</p>

            <h3>How important do you think it is to keep up with the latest trends and technologies in web development?</h3>
            <p>Technology is a fast mutable area. It increases and changes very fast. So, companies are searching for professionals that are always improving themselves.</p>

            <div class="imagem">
                <img src="imagens/web-2.avif" alt="Web development" style="max-width: 530px;">
            </div>

            <h3>How do you deal with the issue of constantly updating technologies in the field of web development? What strategies do you recommend to keep up with the trends?</h3>
            <p>Follow the main technology websites; Follow key professionals and monitor their work; Check what the market is looking for through the main job search sites (Glassdoor, Linkedin).</p>

            <h3>Apart from the languages mentioned, which frameworks do you think are important for a web developer today?</h3>
            <p>To focus (have a strong base) in only one but to know the basics of others. Today, For the frontend: I recommend studying React and NextJS; For the backend: Fastify, NestJS, any ORM (e.g. TypeORM), postgres (as a database).</p>

            <h3>Finally, what would you say to someone who might be considering a career in this field?</h3>
            <p>Do not give up at the first problem, always strive for continuous improvement and get rid of limiting beliefs that don't help you improve in the area.</p>
